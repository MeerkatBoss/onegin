2187:   Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
1750:     chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a
1428:     purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
1482:   Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
3808:     more, ha?
1801:     As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
1324:       Ophelia,'-

3337:                       Enter Ophelia.  
3937:   Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
3246:     In hugger-mugger to inter him; Poor Ophelia
3674:   Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
3343:     Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
1878:     Affront Ophelia.  
3183:   Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
 690:     Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
2034:     Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
3167:   Queen. How now, Ophelia?
3214:   King. Pretty Ophelia!
2453:     speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than a
3715:   Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
1510:     obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a
1567:     holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for a
3738:   Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
1465:   Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
4112:   Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a
1650:     anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us a
1525:     to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a
2060:     whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
1763:   Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
1813:     And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
2826:     Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
1358:     Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
2064:     (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
1920:     To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
1330:     'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
4339:   Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
2383:     Come, some music!
2451:     lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music,  
1133:   Pol. And let him ply his music.
4275:   Ham. No, by this bad.  
 186:     The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
2265:       A second time I kill my husband dead
3949:     Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
3929:     We should profane the service of the dead
4418:     That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
3304:   King. Dead.
4374:     But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
3830:   Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
2296:       But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
3378:            No, no, he is dead;  
 107:   Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.  
2640:   Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
3944:     Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
4119:     bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
 177:     The source of this our watch, and the chief head
3951:     T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
4195:   Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.  
3268:     Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
1731:       With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
1699:       Which was declining on the milky head
 912:     With all my imperfections on my head.
2583:     He took my father grossly, full of bread,
1292:     And at our more consider'd time we'll read,  
 245:     But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
3848:   Ham. How came he mad?
1179:   Pol. That hath made him mad.
2735:   Queen. Alas, he's mad!
1304:     I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
1306:     What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
 240:     And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
 581:     And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
1144:     Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
1736:       'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
2716:     In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
3379:            Go to thy deathbed;
 889:     Will sate itself in a celestial bed
2266:       When second husband kisses me in bed.
2818:     Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
2417:   Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
2532:     I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
2794:     Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
2593:     Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
3228:               An thou hadst not come to my bed.'
4210:     If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided
1230:     To be commanded.
2623:   Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
2624:   Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
 117:   Mar. It is offended.
1297:   Pol. This business is well ended.
1849:   Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
4047:     But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
2666:     As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
2898:     But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
1382:     Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
4122:   Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
 996:   Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
1790:     Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
4273:     Stick fiery off indeed.
3572:   Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
2462:   Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
2682:     A combination and a form indeed
3606:     To show yourself your father's son in deed
1602:    You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
1387:   Queen. So he does indeed.
3578:     That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
2880:   King. O heavy deed!
2688:     Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
2890:     To keep it from divulging, let it feed
4342:   King. She sounds to see them bleed.
2403:   Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
 864:     And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed  
2008:     And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
3243:     Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
3895:     enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
2184:     For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died
1323:     'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
4376:     To the unsatisfied.
1177:     I did repel his letters and denied
 372:     Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
 625:     Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
3143:     Her mood will needs be pitied.
3523:   King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
2123:     Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
1945:     Be all my sins rememb'red.
3039:     Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
 521:   Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
 514:   Ham. Pale or red?
3875:     hath borne me on his back a thousand tunes. And now how abhorred
4042:     That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
 131:     When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
 238:     Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
 195:     Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
2083:     journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
1653:   Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;
3164:                  Enter Ophelia distracted.
1847:   Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
2346:       With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
2345:       Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
1141:   Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
2519:     Which now goes too free-footed.
 267:     The memory be green, and that it us befitted
3364:   Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
3667:     Or like a creature native and indued
1975:   Oph. I was the more deceived.
2295:       So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
4160:     by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
3223:               You promis'd me to wed.'
3113:     Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
3921:     She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
2840:     Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
3312:     Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
2587:     'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
4251:     Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
3918:   Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
1692:       Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
 908:     Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
 490:   Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
1489:   Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
2973:     And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
4242:     And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
3211:             Let in the maid, that out a maid
3941:     I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
2904:     Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
1658:     set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
2035:     You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
2528:     And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
 844:     Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid  
3567:     Come short of what he did.
 492:   Hor. My lord, I did;
1954:   Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
 483:     In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
 209:     Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
1676:          Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
4345:   Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
 649:   Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
3784:   Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and knock'd
 478:     Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
 888:     So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
3436:   Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlook'd
4069:   Hor. How was this seal'd?
 910:     Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
1600:     man is twice a child.
1073:     But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
2696:     Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
2562:     In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
4417:     To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
2892:   Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
 480:     Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd  
4035:     To mine own room again; making so bold  
  59:   Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
 711:   Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
 416:     A little month, or ere those shoes were old
 836:     To what I shall unfold.
1514:   Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold
3637:     Should have a back or second, that might hold
1599:   Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
 365:     An understanding simple and unschool'd;
 927:     And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
2321:     world.
3426:     I do not know from what part of the world
3315:   Laer. My will, not all the world!
4427:     And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
 403:     Seem to me all the uses of this world!
2557:     In the corrupted currents of this world
4174:   Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
1145:     No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
1028:     As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
3299:     That treason can but peep to what it would,
2449:     would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would
3543:   Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
4442:     But let this same be presently perform'd,
2374:   Hor. You might have rhym'd.
2543:     And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
3522:   Laer. Know you the hand?
3910:     The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
 173:     But to recover of us, by strong hand
4199:     a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
3395:     If by direct or by collateral hand
 907:     Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
3964:     Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
4351:     The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
1574:   Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
 142:     So nightly toils the subject of the land,
3769:          And hath shipped me intil the land,
 178:     Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
4094:   Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
4394:     I cannot live to hear the news from England,
4424:     You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
2025:     Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
3841:     into England.
3842:   Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
3021:     For England.
3030:     one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
3026:   Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
3022:   Ham. For England?
3044:     The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;  
1538:     have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
3074:   Capt. Against some part of Poland.  
4389:   Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
 299:     You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
2738:     Th' important acting of your dread command?
1176:   Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
2679:     An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
1225:     Put your dread pleasures more into command
4038:     (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
1764:     speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and
1111:   Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and  
1503:   Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
1475:   Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
1558:     them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
2201:     crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
4166:     rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and
2375:   Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
3732:   Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand  
1410:     pick'd out of ten thousand.
2997:     only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and
3310:     I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
3955:     Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
 217:   Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
4131:     full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
3000:     end.
3369:     died. They say he made a good end.
4458: THE END
1916:     No more; and by a sleep to say we end
2288:       For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
 639:     For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
3466:     And You must put me in your heart for friend,
2424:     your friend.
 850:     And each particular hair to stand an end
1318:     Perpend.
2580:     I, his sole son, do this same villain send
3642:     As make your bouts more violent to that end-
2287:       And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
2874:   Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
 646:   Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
2018:   King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;  
 165:     And carriage of the article design'd,
3121:     That have a father klll'd, a mother stain'd,
1381:     If circumstances lead me, I will find
2253:       And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
2814:     Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
2813:     I must be cruel, only to be kind;
 332:   Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
1958:     Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.  
2254:       Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
2699:     That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
1870:     To hear him so inclin'd.
1481:     mind.
2505:     With all the strength and armour of the mind
1957:     Take these again; for to the noble mind
1541:     lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
1089:     The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
3488:     Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
3540:     And for his death no wind
4091:     To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
 756:     Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
2578:     And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
1779:     That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
4354:     Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
3086:   Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
 765:     Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
 162:     Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
3535:   King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
1245:     Are joyfully return'd.
1165:     And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
 358:     That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
2504:   Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
2541:     And, like a man to double business bound,
1252:     As it hath us'd to do- that I have found  
1259:     He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
1162:     He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
1273:     But better look'd into, he truly found
3570:   Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
2233:     King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
2234:       Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
 779:     It waves you to a more removed ground.
3232:     choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold ground.
3080:     We go to gain a little patch of ground
3986:     Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
1008:   Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
  70:   Hor. Friends to this ground.
3852:   Ham. Upon what ground?
1101:     Your party in converse, him you would sound,
3673:   Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
3672:   Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
1412:   Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god  
 401:     His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
 855:   Ham. O God!
3390:   Laer. Do you see this, O God?
3776:     which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God,
 486:     Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
2798:     That to the use of actions fair and good
1686:   Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
4349:     No medicine in the world can do thee good.
3024:   Ham. Good.  
2790:     Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
 427:     It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
1478:   Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
3233:     My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
1728:   Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
1090:     A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
 188:     As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
 847:     Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
 563:     Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
2761:     Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
2544:     Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
2474:     Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
3122:     Excitements of my reason and my blood,
3327:     Repast them with my blood.
2021:     O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
1701:       So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
2261:   Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!
1735:       Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
4132:     great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card
1815:     Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
 228:     Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
1011:     Never to speak of this that you have heard:
1200:     Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
1674:          Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd  
1271:     His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
3551:     As did that one; and that, in my regard,
3254:     Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
 867:     'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
 892:     Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
1155:   Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
2844:     Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
3032:   King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
3291:   Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
2148:       Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
  61:   Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
1432:     should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.  
1797:     A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
3692: Elsinore. A churchyard.
1810:     That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
2391:   Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.  
2113:     To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
 526:     A sable silver'd.
2884:     Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
4203:                             Enter a Lord.
 317:   Laer. My dread lord,
1652:   1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
4111:   Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
 439:   Mar. My good lord!
1092:   Rey. But, my good lord-
4285:   Osr. Ay, my good lord.
1244:   Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
1453:   Guil. My honour'd lord!
 955:   Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
2807:     I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,  
3269:     O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
1454:   Ros. My most dear lord!
2109:   Hor. O, my dear lord!
1589:   Guil. In what, my dear lord?
3779:   Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
4217:                                                     [Exit Lord.]
1421:     read, my lord?
1425:   Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
 507:   Both. Arm'd, my lord.
1507:   Ros. To what end, my lord?
1946:   Oph. Good my lord,
 442:   Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
1771:   Ros. Good my lord!
4222:   Hor. Nay, good my lord -
4058:   Hor. Ay, good my lord.
1108:   Rey. Very good, my lord.
 789:   Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
 946:   Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!
2983:   Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
 979:   Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
2943:   Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
1617:   Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
1985:   Oph. At home, my lord.
1404:   Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
3190:   Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
1959:     There, my lord.
 458:   Hor. O, where, my lord?
3809:   Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
1411:   Pol. That's very true, my lord.
 645:   Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
1414:   Pol. I have, my lord.
2228:   Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
3265:   Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
2956:   Guil. A thing, my lord?
2176:   Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
1080:   Rey. As gaming, my lord.
 677:   Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
1961:   Oph. My lord?
1004:   Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.  
 961:   Mar. Nor I, my lord.
1406:   Pol. Not I, my lord.
1873:   Ros. We shall, my lord.
1132:   Rey. I shall, my lord.
2142:   Hor. Well, my lord.
1448:   Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
1134:   Rey. Well, my lord.
4278:   Ham. Very well, my lord.
2377:   Hor. Very well, my lord.
1071:   Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.  
1056:   Rey. I will, my lord.
 719:     What does this mean, my lord?
1628:   Pol. What follows then, my lord?
 964:   Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.  
2988:   Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.
1472:   Guil. Prison, my lord?  
 505:   Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
 801:   Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
3093:   Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
 953:   Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
2172:   Oph. No, my lord.
3889:   Hor. E'en so, my lord.
1477:   Ros. We think not so, my lord.
2534:   King. Thanks, dear my lord.
4218:   Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
1461:   Ros. Neither, my lord.
1606:   Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
1423:   Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
1434:    Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
 976:   Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
2356:   Queen. How fares my lord?
2186:   Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
3586:   Laer. What out of this, my lord?
2210:   Oph. What means this, my lord?
2178:   Oph. What is, my lord?
2333:   Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
 956:   Hor. What news, my lord?
3553:   Laer. What part is that, my lord?
3884:   Hor. What's that, my lord?
2408:   Guil. What, my lord?
3778:   Hor. It might, my lord.
2442:   Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
4021:   Hor. Remember it, my lord!
4337:   Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
3065:   Capt. I will do't, my lord.
 783:   Hor. Do not, my lord!
2950:   Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
1408:   Pol. Honest, my lord?
3678:     The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
1906:   Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
2174:   Oph. Ay, my lord.
2182:   Oph. Ay, my lord.
3533:   Laer. Ay my lord,
3783:   Hor. Ay, my lord.
1502:   Guil. What should we say, my lord?
1762:   1. Play. Ay, my lord.
1766:   1. Play. Ay, my lord.
1094:   Rey. Ay, my lord,
 700:   Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
2180:   Oph. You are merry, my lord.
1904:     Than is my deed to my most painted word.
2318:   Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
2004:     The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
1690:       Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
1712:       With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
1694:       But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword  
1698:       Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
1013:   Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
 994:   Ham. Upon my sword.
1010:     And lay your hands again upon my sword.
3623:     And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
1006:     Swear by my sword.
1012:     Swear by my sword.
 846:     I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
 943:     So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
2649:   Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
3272:     The ratifiers and props of every word,
 279:     Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
1103:     The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
3564:     As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
1654:     or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas'd  
4334:   King. Part them! They are incens'd.
 599:     Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
3993:     When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,  
1955:     And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
2553:     That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
 496:     But even then the morning cock crew loud,
1882:     And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
2977:     By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
1274:     It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
1588:     and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
2768:     My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
 886:     But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
4363:   Laer. He is justly serv'd.
3476:     Which may to you, perhaps, seein much unsinew'd,
4068:     Not shriving time allow'd.
1551:     city? Are they so follow'd?
2928:   Ham. Safely stow'd.
 400:     Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd  
2366:     fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my raz'd
   7: Dramatis Personae
2571:     Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
1203:     Resembles that it was. What it should be,
2164:   Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be
4008:     Till then in patience our proceeding be.
 915:     Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
1732:       Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
2940:   Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
 638:     Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
3935:     A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
4186:     it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
4231:     what is't to leave betimes? Let be.
4228:     the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come', if it be
 342:   Queen. If it be,
3103:     To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
3668:     Unto that element; but long it could not be
1802:     'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
 852:     But this eternal blazon must not be
4113:     vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast be
2272:       But fill unshaken when they mellow be.
3534:     So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
3089:     This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
4263:     I have a voice and precedent of peace
2139:     For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
 510:   Ham. Then saw you not his face?
4322:   Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
1158:     He falls to such perusal of my face
1799:     Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
2152:     Get you a place.
1346:     As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
 585:     As he in his particular act and place
2782:     It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
  75:   Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
 616:     A double blessing is a double grace;
2779:     Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
 746:     Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
 133:     He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
2697:     But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
2117:     Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
 203:     If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
4396:     On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
 631:     Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
3541:     But even his mother shall uncharge the practice  
3620:     A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
4352:     Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
2558:     Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
1126:     So, by my former lecture and advice,
1366:     Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
 247:     Break we our watch up; and by my advice  
3538:     To exploit now ripe in my device,
2106:   Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
1536:     on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
1808:     O, vengeance!
1118:     There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
4370:     You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
4443:     Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
3635:     And that our drift look through our bad performance.
4454:             Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
1222:     As fits a king's remembrance.
 322:     My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
3250:     Her brother is in secret come from France;
 318:     Your leave and favour to return to France;
4271:   Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
4020:     You do remember all the circumstance?
2130:     One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
1843:   King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
 666:     Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
 729:     More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
1289:     On such regards of safety and allowance
2077:     grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
2885:     It will be laid to us, whose providence
3701:     defence?
3576:     For art and exercise in your defence,
2547:     But to confront the visage of offence?
2556:     May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
3311:     That both the world, I give to negligence,
3017:     For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
2936:   Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
4090:     And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
1901:     How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
4325:   Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
4436:     And call the noblest to the audience.
4253:     Sir, in this audience,
2166:   Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
3613:     We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
 223:     To offer it the show of violence;
 444:     Nor shall you do my ear that violence

3558:     Importing health and graveness. Two months since
3838:   Ham. How long is that since?
2158:   Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
 921:     To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
1970:     but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
2399:   Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
3332:     It shall as level to your judgment pierce
2548:     And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
3792:          O, a Pit of clay for to be made  
3816:     [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
1740:       The instant burst of clamour that she made
3950:     Till of this flat a mountain you have made
1999:     wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath made
 297:     The lists, and full proportions are all made
3790:          A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
 610:     And recks not his own rede.
2736:   Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
 154:     Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,

1693:       Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
3239:     All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
3301:     Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
3681:   King. Let's follow, Gertrude.

3084:     A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
 785:     I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
1642:     You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see thee
 630:     Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
 620:     And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
 343:     Why seems it so particular with thee?
2111:     For what advancement may I hope from thee,  
 644:     Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
4366:     Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
 930:     In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
 928:     But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
4368:   Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
 800:     Go on. I'll follow thee.
 810:     I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.

2334:   Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
4134:     what part a gentleman would see.
1665:     your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:
3638:     If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
4007:     An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
3123:     And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
4100:     For by the image of my cause I see
2764:   Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
2014:     T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
4408:   Hor. What is it you will see?
2502:     To keep those many many bodies safe
1444:     life,
4350:     In thee there is not half an hour of life.
1924:     That makes calamity of so long life.
3712:     guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.  
1796:     Upon whose property and most dear life
4089:     Thrown out his angle for my Proper life,
2189:     yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life
 525:   Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
3345:     Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
 871:     The serpent that did sting thy father's life
 211:     Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
3469:     Pursued my life.
4041:     With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
 249:     Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
1932:     To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
2303:       Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
2304:       If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
2353:     shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
2631:     You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
3940:     I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
 890:     And prey on garbage.
3494:     Stood challenger on mount of all the age
 277:     With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
1262:     His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
1002:     Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
2592:     When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
1183:     By heaven, it is as proper to our age
2690:     You cannot call it love; for at your age
 349:     Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
1897:     'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
2589:     When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?  
4448:     To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
 287:     He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
 286:     Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
4446:     Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
 998:                  Ghost cries under the stage.
3056: Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.
2517:   King. Arm you, I pray you, to th', speedy voyage;
 724:     The triumph of his pledge.
1871:     Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
2337:   Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
 920:     And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
1881:     We may of their encounter frankly judge
1247:   Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
2531:     The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
3552:     Of the unworthiest siege.
2282:       That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
4288:     Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
 134:     'Tis strange.
1016:   Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
2281:       This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
 499:   Ham. 'Tis very strange.
3356:   Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
2341:     bellow for revenge.
3320:     Of your dear father's death, is't writ in Your revenge
2582:     Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
 862:     May sweep to my revenge.
3111:     Witness this army of such mass and charge,
1084:   Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
2708:     When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
4064:     And many such-like as's of great charge,
3847:     he.
1154:   Pol. What said he?
3897:     earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto he
  56:   Ber. He.
4196:   Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,
1348:   King. But how hath she
2985:   King. But where is he?
 418:     Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she

4353:     Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
1026:     With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
1367:     And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,

 241:     The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
3279:   King. The doors are broke.
3661:     Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,  
1199:     The need we have to use you did provoke
3740:   Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
2465:   Ham. Or like a whale.
2466:   Pol. Very like a whale.
 122:   Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
 515:   Hor. Nay, very pale.
1119:     'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
 224:     For it is as the air, invulnerable,
1351:   King. As of a man faithful and honourable.

2308:     King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
3946:     Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,

1219:     As to expend your time with us awhile
4310:   Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
4385:     Absent thee from felicity awhile,

2309:       My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile

1146:     Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
 278:     In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
3892:     stopping a bunghole?

2726:     That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
3104:     Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
 132:     So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
  47: Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.
 707: Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.
2924: Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.
 260: Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.
4015: Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

 618:   Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
3218:               Alack, and fie for shame!
3220:               By Cock, they are to blame.
4355:     I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.  
4382:     O good Horatio, what a wounded name
3081:     That hath in it no profit but the name.
3658:     That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
2915:     Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
2324:     image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's name;
 285:     Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
3571:   King. The very same.
3222:             Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
2163:     kill'd me.
3394:     And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
4383:     (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
 371:     To reason most absurd, whose common theme

1978:     me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.  
1150:     To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
3525:     Can you advise me?
4439:     Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
2434:     you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me
2420:   Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
1350:   Pol. What do you think of me?
4328:     I am afeard You make a wanton of me.
3422:   Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
3410:     I pray you go with me.
2809:     To punish me with this, and this with me,
3205:               All in the morning bedtime,
1301:     Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
 243:     So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
1925:     For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
 485:     Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
2775:     My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
4208:     take longer time.
1859:     To any pastime?
1300:     Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
3098:     If his chief good and market of his time
 684:     You must not take for fire. From this time
4264:     To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
3592:     But that I know love is begun by time,
4213:   Ham. In happy time.
 829:   Ghost. Mark me.
3470:   Laer. It well appears. But tell me
4237:   King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
 149:     Who is't that can inform me?
2758:     Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
2455:     you cannot play upon me.
1168:     And to the last bended their light on me.
 658:     If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
1344:     This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
1189:     Come.
 954:   Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
3656:     There with fantastic garlands did she come
 544:     I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
4092:     To let this canker of our nature come
2402:   Ham. You are welcome.
1017:   Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
3495:     For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
4229:     not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:
 390:     Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
3526:   Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
3737:     church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come!
  89:     That, if again this apparition come,
2785:     Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
 814:   Hor. Have after. To what issue wail this come?
 831:   Ghost. My hour is almost come,
1020:     But come!
3013:   Ham. He will stay till you come.
1921:     For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
2930:   Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
3612:     Will return'd shall know you are come home.
3925:     Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
2527:     To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
1605:     Rome-
 184:     In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
1239:                  Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
2835:     What thou hast said to me.
 206:     That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
 204:     Speak to me.
 207:     Speak to me.  
 664:     Of his affection to me.
 482:     Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
1178:     His access to me.
 944:     It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'  
2637:   Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
 761:     King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
4270:   Laer. Come, one for me.
 503:   Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
2013:     Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
4216:   Ham. She well instructs me.
 809:     By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
3453:     And do't the speedier that you may direct me
1468:   Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
2454:     pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me,
1869:   King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
2629:   Queen. Have you forgot me?
1533:   Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
3110:     To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
2660:     In noise so rude against me?
3096:     How all occasions do inform against me
4102:     But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
3532:     Will you be rul'd by me?
2167:   Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
4378:     I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
4360:   Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
  71:   Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
 310:     You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
1817:     Have by the very cunning of the scene
1612:     tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; scene  
1278:     Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
3803:     his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
3346:     Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
3501:     And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-  
 329:   King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
4306:   King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
3982:     I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
 883:     I made to her in marriage, and to decline
2157:     mine.
 885:     To those of mine!
1250:     And I do think- or else this brain of mine
1319:     I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
4096:   Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
3821:     For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
 903:     The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
3207:               To be your Valentine.
 851:     Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
 608:     Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
4172:     ere you had done.
3034:     Away! for everything is seal'd and done
3927:   Laer. Must there no more be done?
3928:   Priest. No more be done.
2240:       Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
 205:     If there be any good thing to be done,
4243:     With sore distraction. What I have done
1474:   Ros. Then is the world one.
2895:     Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
3046:     And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
2643:   Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
 321:     Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
3178:               He is dead and gone;
2891:     Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
3677:     Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
 102:     The bell then beating one-
3384:            He is gone, he is gone,
 220:   Mar. 'Tis gone!
 280:     Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone  
1774:     Now I am alone.  
2515:     Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
3524:     And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
 777:     To you alone.
 570:     For nature crescent does not grow alone
4301:   Ham. One.
3724:   Other. Why, he had none.
2480:     I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
3170:            From another one?
 377:     You are the most immediate to our throne,
3180:               At his heels a stone.
3486:     Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
4097:     And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
2883:     To you yourself, to us, to every one.  
3987:     Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
1711:       On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
1913:     The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
2652:     I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
4437:     For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
3321:     That swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe,
1460:   Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
3833:     I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe  
 508:   Ham. From top to toe?
3943:   Laer. O, treble woe
 354:     These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
 269:     To be contracted in one brow of woe,
1990:     be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
 531:     I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
 759:     Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
 476:     Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
2830:     Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
2437:   Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
 302:     To business with the King, more than the scope
2300:       An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
2299:       To desperation turn my trust and hope,
1220:     For the supply and profit of our hope,
2703:     Could not so mope.
3116:     To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
   3: by William Shakespeare
1614:     Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
2368:   Hor. Half a share.
3626:     Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
4150:   Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
1542:     freely, or the blank verse shall halt fort. What players are
2000:     me mad. I say, we will have no moe marriages. Those that are
1648:     uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you are
 628:     Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
 727:     But to my mind, though I am native here  
2614:     Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
4361:     Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
 981:     And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
3481:     That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,  
1776:     Is it not monstrous that this player here,
4104:   Hor. Peace! Who comes here?
 218:   Ber. 'Tis here!
 219:   Hor. 'Tis here!
2372:          Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
 934:     That youth and observation copied there,
 168:     Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
2763:   Ham. Do you see nothing there?
 518:   Ham. I would I had been there.
2881:     It had been so with us, had we been there.
  79:     What, is Horatio there ?
3844:     or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
 880:     O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
  69:   Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  52:   Ber. Who's there.?
4095:     What is the issue of the business there.  
3843:   Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits there;
2250:       Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
2042:     To England send him; or confine him where
3653:   Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
2994:   King. At supper? Where?
1877:     That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
1499:     and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
 764:     Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
1680:          To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
4289:     Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
1334:           'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
2355:   Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
 923:     And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
 776:     As if it some impartment did desire
 973:     For every man hath business and desire,
 594:     Out of the shot and danger of desire.
 382:     It is most retrograde to our desire;
4033:     Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
1058:     Before You visit him, to make inquire
2893:     O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
3094:   Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.  
1681:          And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
3212:               Never departed more.
4141:     would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
2506:     To keep itself from noyance; but much more
1442:   Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
4441:     And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
 567:     No more.
1620:          'One fair daughter, and no more,
1746:     eyes. Prithee no more!
2719:   Queen. O, speak to me no more!
2711:   Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
2728:   Queen. No more!
 569:   Laer. Think it no more.
3099:     Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
3499:     And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
1279:     Makes vow before his uncle never more
4143:   Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
1770:     Elsinore.
  43: SCENE.- Elsinore.
 447:     But what is your affair in Elsinore?
3054: Near Elsinore.
1496:     make you at Elsinore?
1383:     Within the centre.
2497:     The terms of our estate may not endure
1311:     And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
2734:     You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
 180:     Well may it sort that this portentous figure
2986:   Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
4209:   Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.
4046:   Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
 697:     Have you so slander any moment leisure
3115:     Exposing what is mortal and unsure
1251:     Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
2073:     'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own feature,
2803:     For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
 770:     Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
 843:     Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
 270:     Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
4258:   Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
3472:     So crimeful and so capital in nature,
 405:     That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
 370:     A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
 564:     A violet in the youth of primy nature,
3725:   Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?
2894:     Among a mineral of metals base,
3618:     Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
2036:     We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
2889:     But, like the owner of a foul disease,
1327:       phrase.
 732:     They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
1027:     Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
 672:     Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
3071:   Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
3249:     Last, and as such containing as all these,
1321:     Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
3646:     Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,
 545:     Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
 170:     For food and diet, to some enterprise
1288:     Through your dominions for this enterprise,
2825:     For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
1377:     When it prov'd otherwise.?
1380:       be otherwise.
3531:     (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
4140:     true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else
2190:     half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or else
3473:     As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
 925:   Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
3914:   Laer. What ceremony else?
3917:   Laer. What ceremony else?
3765:     sense.
3038:     As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
2702:     Or but a sickly part of one true sense
 367:     As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
3945:     Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
2694:     Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
2658:     That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
2122:     Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
3876:     in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those
2191:     shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose  
1540:     end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
2022:     And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
2276:       The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
3619:     Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
2969:     How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
2275:       What to ourselves in passion we propose,
2741:     Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
4187:     brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose,
2663:     Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
 191:     Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
3563:     And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
1673:          When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
2338:   Oph. Still better, and worse.
 361:     In obstinate condolement is a course
3448:     thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course
2749:     And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
3100:     Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
4071:     I had my father's signet in my purse,
4431:     Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
3127:     Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
1316:     For this effect defective comes by cause.
1794:     Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,  
1887:     That your good beauties be the happy cause
1708:       Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
1977:     sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse
4256:     That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
 845:     To tell the secrets of my prison house,
2819:     Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
 720:   Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
1117:     There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
 208:     If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
1548:   Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
2241:       But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
1175:     What, have you given him any hard words of late?
 655:     'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
4415:     And our affairs from England come too late.  
4320:   King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
1298:     My liege, and madam, to expostulate
 686:     Set your entreatments at a higher rate
1392:     Let me be no assistant for a state,  
3911:     Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
 274:     Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
 580:     The safety and health of this whole state,
1852:     Of his true state.
2242:       So far from cheer and from your former state.
2005:     Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
 139:     This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
 172:     As it doth well appear unto our state,
1042:     The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
 376:     As of a father; for let the world take note
2138:     As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
1030:     Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
4057:     Th' effect of what I wrote?
  65:     The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
3035:     That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
3267:     Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
 147:     What might be toward, that this sweaty haste  
2026:     For the demand of our neglected tribute.
 735:     The pith and marrow of our attribute.
 566:     The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
2626:   Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
2625:   Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
 622:     Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
 536:     Give it an understanding but no tongue.
2659:   Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
 428:     But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
2214:                       Enter Prologue.
 641:     This above all- to thine own self be true,
1900:   King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
 500:   Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;  
1866:   Pol. 'Tis most true;
3627:     Collected from all simples that have virtue
2787:     To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;  
 617:     Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
1400:     I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
3285:   Laer. I pray you give me leave.
1110:     By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
 325:   Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
2339:   Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox, leave
3144:   Queen. What would she have?
1936:     And makes us rather bear those ills we have
1128:   Rey. My lord, I have.
2693:     Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
2947:     first mouth'd, to be last Swallowed. When he needs what you have
3437:     this, give these fellows some means to the King. They have
2852:     Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
 966:     But he's an arrant knave.
1809:     Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
3970:                                                          grave.]
 967:   Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
3948:                                              Leaps in the grave.
3983:     To outface me with leaping in her grave?
2851:     Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
3942:     And not have strew'd thy grave.
1435:   Ham. Into my grave?
2032:   Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
 125:   Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
1339:     reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best, believe
3016:     Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
2376:     pound! Didst perceive?
1575:     those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
3396:     They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
1980:     beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
 935:     And thy commandment all alone shall live
2715:   Ham. Nay, but to live
1751:     bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
 918:     Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
2168:   Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
3482:     I could not but by her. The other motive
 538:     Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
 714:   Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
2560:     Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
3992:     Anon, as patient as the female dove
3355:     Fare you well, my dove!
3758:        To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
3756:        In youth when I did love, did love,
4265:     I do receive your offer'd love like love,
2284:       Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
3595:     There lives within the very flame of love
2264:       Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
 861:     As meditation or the thoughts of love,
1170:     This is the very ecstasy of love,
 378:     And with no less nobility of love
3975:     Could not (with all their quantity of love)
2717:     Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
 674:   Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
1337:             But never doubt I love.
 854:     If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
1188:     More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
2887:     This mad young man. But so much was our love
2207:     his love.
1349:     Receiv'd his love?
2229:   Ham. As woman's love.
2664:     From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
3362:   Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
1151:   Pol. Mad for thy love?  
2263:     Queen. The instances that second marriage move
1335:             Doubt that the sun doth move;
3149:     Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
1187:     This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
2283:       For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
 806:     As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
3040:     After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
3901:     O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
1464:   Guil. Faith, her privates we.
4043:     No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
 348:     No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
3340:     Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
 276:     With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
3580:     He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
 384:     Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
3333:     As day does to your eye.
 183:   Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
3063:     We shall express our duty in his eye;
4298:     And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
1772:   Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
3679:     I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
3609:   King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
2211:   Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.  
1749:     hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and brief
3953:   Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief  
 350:     Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
3391:   King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
2033:     The origin and commencement of his grief
 362:     Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
3171:          By his cockle bat and' staff
 790:     Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
4044:     My head should be struck off.
 718:                    A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
3745:                  Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.
 335:   Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
4455:                                                    are shot off.  
1515:     not off.
2656:     If it be made of penetrable stuff;
3434:     sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that was bound for England- if
1577:     little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if
2793:     And live the purer with the other half,
2678:     Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
1205:     So much from th' understanding of himself,
2426:   Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself
1899:     The Devil himself.
4158:     excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
4364:     It is a poison temper'd by himself.
3662:     When down her weedy trophies and herself
3500:     I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
  53:   Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
1131:   Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.  
 656:     Given private time to you, and you yourself
2559:     And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
3347:     It sends some precious instance of itself
3373:   Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
 787:     Being a thing immortal as itself?  
1171:     Whose violent property fordoes itself  
3018:     With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
 129:   Hor. As thou art to thyself.
3980:     Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
3728:     purpose, confess thyself-
 101:     Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
 833:     Must render up myself.
1022:     How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
3478:     Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
 434:     Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
4099:     That to Laertes I forgot myself,
2526:     Behind the arras I'll convey myself
4136:     know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of
4168:     very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
1647:     altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
2325:     his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece of
1484:   Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of
3802:     fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of
 392:     Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
3804:     pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of
3438:     letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of  
3868:   Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon of
1850:     But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
3593:     And that I see, in passages of proof,
3750:     till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
1976:   Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
1760:     Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
3862:     keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of
1660:     nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
2080:     speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
4133:     or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of
1937:     Than fly to others that we know not of?
2070:     this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
 865:     That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
3179:             At his head a grass-green turf,
3972:     Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
3583:     That he could nothing do but wish and beg
2789:     Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
2196:     Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
1398:   Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
 451:     I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
1064:     What company, at what expense; and finding
2343:     Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
2199:     neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
2344:       Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
2955:     The King is a thing-
1831:     More relative than this. The play's the thing
2428:   Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is something
3883:     tell me one thing.
3521:     Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?  
1703:       Did nothing.
2179:   Ham. Nothing.
  83:   Ber. I have seen nothing.
1782:     With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
3148:     That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
2120:     As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
1524:     roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing
 227:   Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing  
3298:     There's such divinity doth hedge a king
2942:     of a king?
2648:   Queen. As kill a king?
 683:     Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
3762:     grave-making?
1795:     And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
2848:     This man shall set me packing.
3273:     They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
2953:     the King.
 181:     Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
 128:   Mar. Is it not like the King?
2129:     There is a play to-night before the King.
  54:   Ber. Long live the King!
1169:   Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
4059:   Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
1186:     To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
2332:     This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
3903:     But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-
4357:     Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
2644:   Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
3288:     O thou vile king,
3058:   For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
3905:     Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
2966: Enter King.
3188:                     Enter King.
1099:     As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
 312:     That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
3275:     'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
1249:     Both to my God and to my gracious king;
  11:   Hamlet, son to the former, and nephew to the present king.
 151:     At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
 460:   Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.  
1597:     That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
1081:   Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
3936:     When thou liest howling.
2141:     In censure of his seeming.
2617:   Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him coming.
2378:   Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
 231:     Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
2065:     shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing
1130:   Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
3994:     His silence will sit drooping.
3644:     A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
4416:     The ears are senseless that should give us bearing
 835:   Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
2227:   Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
3447:     light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring
 598:     The canker galls the infants of the spring
  62:   Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
 291:     Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
4022:   Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
1781:     A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
 565:     Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
1216:     And sure I am two men there are not living
3617:     Most generous, and free from all contriving,
1353:     When I had seen this hot love on the wing
2071:     nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,  
2143:     If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
2576:   Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
2335:     the puppets dallying.
  87:     Therefore I have entreated him along,  
1720:   Pol. This is too long.
 239:     The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
 520:   Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?  
4239:   Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
3174:   Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
 688:     Believe so much in him, that he is young,
2328:     are unwrung.
 441:     But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
 381:     In going back to school in Wittenberg,
 387:     I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
1624:   Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
1455:   Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
3887:   Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
3813:     will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
1123:     And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
1788:     And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
2135:     Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
1651:     taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
4003:     [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech.
1429:     plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which,
1437:     his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which
3479:     My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
1824:     I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
4177:     assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the French
3560:     I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
4165:     against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
4409:     If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
3060:     Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
 477:     Appears before them and with solemn march
 574:     And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
3608:   Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
 298:     Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
2495:     I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
 484:     And I with them the third night kept the watch;
 473:     (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
 136:     With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
 141:     Why this same strict and most observant watch
3768:            Hath clawed me in his clutch,
4054:     A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
3547:     You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
2897:     The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
 126:     Without the sensible and true avouch
3770:            As if I had never been such.
2409:   Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
3603:     And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
2075:     form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though
 595:     The chariest maid is prodigal enough
 899:     That swift as quicksilverr it courses through
3005:   Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
1697:       Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
3962:     For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
3933:     And from her fair and unpolluted flesh  
2146:     Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
4061:     As love between them like the palm might flourish,
1886:     And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish

1933:     But that the dread of something after death-
4422:     He never gave commandment for their death.
2567:     O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
3330:     That I am guiltless of your father's death,
3253:     With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
2131:     Which I have told thee, of my father's death.  
 284:     Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
 266:   King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death

 798:     And hears it roar beneath.
 347:     Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
2833:   Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
4314:   Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
4290:     The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
4144:     rawer breath
1996:   Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
4180:     yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
3805:     his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth
3528:     That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
1583:   Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'

 682:     Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
4280:   King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
1206:     I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
2340:     thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
 411:     Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
1521:     heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
1457:   Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
 212:     Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
3885:   Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th' earth?
3932:   Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
4296:     The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,

3129:     To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
 696:     I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
1120:     Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
 283:     Holding a weak supposal of our worth,

 600:     And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
2012:     That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
 662:     What is between you? Give me up the truth.
1122:     Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
1142:   Pol. With what, i' th' name of God I
3682:     How much I had to do to calm his rage I
2634:   Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge I

 150:   Hor. That can I.
3857:     pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in, I
2181:   Ham. Who, I?
3441:     boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
1655:     not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as I
1981:     them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I
2128:     As I do thee. Something too much of this I
3956:     Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
3812:   Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I  
1625:   Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
2078:     o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I
1792:     Yet I,
 992:     My lord, not I.
1952:   Ham. No, not I!
3417: Scene VI.

3367:     O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy. I
1793:     A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
 495:     Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
1361:     And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
 119:   Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
 116:     Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
1820:     For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
2633:   Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
 210:     O, speak!
4440:   Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
1848:     But from what cause he will by no means speak.
4294:     And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
2267:     King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
3328:   King. Why, now You speak
1501:     visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay, speak.
2268:       But what we do determine oft we break.
3520:     What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
2837:   Queen. Alack,

 346:     Nor customary suits of solemn black,
1284:     So levied as before, against the Polack;

1352:   Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,  
3669:     Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
4318:   King. Gertrude, do not drink.
1396:                  Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

1637:     The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look
2755:     Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?

4032:     My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
3912:     Couch we awhile, and mark.
1320:     Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
3916:     A very noble youth. Mark.
 115:     In which the majesty of buried Denmark
   0: THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK
 815:   Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
   9:   Claudius, King of Denmark.
 868:     A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
3166:   Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
 965:   Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
2427:     for your succession in Denmark?
 336:     And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
 319:     From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
4108:   Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
3184:   Oph. Pray you mark.
3175:   Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.
1709:       Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
2097:     How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
1360:     What might you think? No, I went round to work
2842:     And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
 145:     Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
 222:     We do it wrong, being so majestical,
1523:     air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
 750:     Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.
3465:   King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
4072:     which was the model of that Danish seal;
4036:     (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
2683:     Where every god did seem to set his seal
2108:     As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
 587:     Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
4181:     laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
4184:   Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
3926:     Of bell and burial.
3716:     gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.
3699:     The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
 895:     With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
4414:   Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
3403:     His means of death, his obscure funeral-
 449:   Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
1611:     history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
 859:     But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
2479:     Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
2769:     Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
3651:   Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
1716:       Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
2510:     What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
 768:     That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
2570:     Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
 626:     Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
2461:   Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
2937:     And bear it to the chapel.
2028:     With variable objects, shall expel
3898:     was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
2464:   Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
2463:   Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
2216:   Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel;
4137:     memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
 619:     The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
 749:     From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
1922:     When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
2435:     into a toil?
4254:     Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
3308:     To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
4093:     In further evil?
1557:     the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
2058:     not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
3634:     May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
3409:     And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
2549:     To be forestalled ere we come to fall,  
  98:   Ber. Last night of all,
1710:       And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
3539:     Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
1803:     But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
2655:     And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
1539:     target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall
1025:     That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
3408:   King. So you shall;
1537:   Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
2217:     they'll tell all.
 461:   Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
2882:     His liberty is full of threats to all-
 695:     The better to beguile. This is for all:
1982:     do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all;
2701:     Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
1938:     Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,  
 970:     And so, without more circumstance at all,
1741:       (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
2978:     Or not at all.
1309:   Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
 532:     And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
4411:     What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
 185:     A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
1811:     Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
1149:     As if he had been loosed out of hell
 757:     Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
2704:     O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
 394:     But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
3741:   Other. Marry, now I can tell!
3743:   Other. Mass, I cannot tell.
 762:     Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
1994:     Farewell.
 557:   Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
3449:     for England. Of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
1987:     nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
2651:     Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
1135:   Pol. Farewell!
3938:   Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
 541:   Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
 306:   King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
1129:   Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
1621:            The which he loved passing well.'
1626:     love passing well.
1948:   Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
3316:     And for my means, I'll husband them so well
 647:   Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
2811:     I will bestow him, and will answer well
3734:   Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does well.
1291:   King. It likes us well;
4026:     Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
 543:     My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
3960:   Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
1072:   Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
4163:   Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
 433:   Ham. I am glad to see you well.
 537:     I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
1853:   Queen. Did he receive you well?
3306:   King. Let him demand his fill.
 246:     Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
2681:     New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
2899:     We must with all our majesty and skill
2447:     have not the skill.
3726:     The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms? I'll
1705:       A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
 534:     Let it be tenable in your silence still;
 799:   Ham. It waves me still.
3597:     And nothing is at a like goodness still;
3861:   Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a will
1218:     To show us so much gentry and good will
1935:     No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
4191:   Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
 987:   Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
3286:   All. We will, we will!
4029:     Rough-hew them how we will-
 830:   Ham. I will.
2539:     Though inclination be as sharp as will.
3806:     of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will
2710:     And reason panders will.
3747:   Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will
2444:     fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it will
 529:   Hor. I warr'nt it will.
3393:     Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
4207:     know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will
 330:     And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
3383:          All flaxen was his poll.
3497:     That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
 167:     Of unimproved mettle hot and full,  
3042:     Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
3771:                                             [Throws up a skull.]
3888:                                           [Puts down the skull.]
3794:                                       Throws up [another skull].
 673:     Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.  
1986:   Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
 665:   Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
 957:   Mar. O, wonderful!
3919:     As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
2137:     And my imaginations are as foul
 873:   Ham. O my prophetic soul!
 572:     The inward service of the mind and soul
3480:     She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
 680:     When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
2743:     O, step between her and her fighting soul
3400:     And we shall jointly labour with your soul
2780:     Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
2588:     To take him in the purging of his soul,
2020:     Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
3386:          God 'a'mercy on his soul!
3958:   Laer. The devil take thy soul!
2133:     Even with the very comment of thy soul
1248:     I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
2712:     Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
4317:   Ham. Good madam!
 388:   Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
1485:     the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
3655:     That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
1713:       Now falls on Priam.
 351:     'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
2975:     This sudden sending him away must seem
1535:     entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them
3152:     Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
3490:     And not where I had aim'd them.
2868:     You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
3510:     They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
1951:     I pray you, now receive them.
2087:     speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
3659:     But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
 667:     Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
2100:     help to hasten them?
 737:     That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
3512:   King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
3508:   King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
3511:     Of him that brought them.
1564:     are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
2906:     And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
1861:     We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
 156:     (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
3643:     And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
1865:     This night to play before him.
1995:   Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
 951:   Hor. Heaven secure him!
2379:   Hor. I did very well note him.
  85:     And will not let belief take hold of him
  80:   Hor. A piece of him.
1068:     Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
2390:   Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
4142:   Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
2039:     To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
2615:     Pray you be round with him.
1207:     That, being of so young clays brought up with him,
3959:                                             [Grapples with him].
3537:     No more to undertake it, I will work him
3799:     him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him
2984:     We cannot get from him.  
3550:     Did not together pluck such envy from him
4159:   Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him
 412:     Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
 271:     That we with wisest sorrow think on him
3991:     And thus a while the fit will work on him.
1085:     You must not put another scandal on him,
4001:   King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
1074:     Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
2970:     Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
2611:   Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
 250:     This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
1237:     Pleasant and helpful to him!
1388:   Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
1341:       'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
3484:     Is the great love the general gender bear him,
3978:   Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
2126:     That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
 290:     To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
4450:     Speak loudly for him.
1083:   Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
1689:   1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
  50: at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].
2038:     Let his queen mother all alone entreat him  
1263:   King. Well, we shall sift him.
1204:     More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
3873:   Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him,  
 817:   Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
1858:   Queen. Did you assay him  
3305:   Queen. But not by him!
 813:   Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
 268:     To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
4438:     I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
3106:     A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
2671:     With tristful visage, as against the doom,
2849:     I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
2478:     The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
 728:     And to the manner born, it is a custom
 725:   Hor. Is it a custom?
1160:     At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
 242:     No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
2751:     And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
1156:     Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
 359:     In filial obligation for some term
 114:     Together with that fair and warlike form
 792:     And there assume some other, horrible form
2006:     The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
3705:     act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
1967:   Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
1704:       But, as we often see, against some storm,
3003:     of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
1695:       Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
4404:     Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
3326:     And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
1561:     escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
1968:     honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
3704:     the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and an
1212:     So much as from occasion you may glean,  
 767:     To cast thee up again. What may this mean  
3545:     That I might be the organ.
3775:     did the first murther! This might be the pate of a Politician,
2684:     To give the world assurance of a man.
3097:     And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
4380:   Ham. As th'art a man,
1407:   Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
2107:   Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
2879:     The unseen good old man.
1202:     Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
 635:     For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
1112:     gentleman.'
3139: Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.
3722:   Other. Was he a gentleman?
1854:   Ros. Most like a gentleman.
4240:     But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
1114:     He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
4130:     newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman,
3329:     Like a good child and a true gentleman.
1105:     'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
4148:   Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman
3158:                                                [Exit Gentleman.]
1409:   Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
 898:     Holds such an enmity with blood of man
3302:     Speak, man.
4224:     would perhaps trouble a woman.
1530:     is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor woman
 415:     Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
 938:     O most pernicious woman!
3569:   King. A Norman.
2125:     To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
 643:     Thou canst not then be false to any man.
3385:            And we cast away moan.
2516:     Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
 216:   Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
 404:     Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
2236:       About the world have times twelve thirties been,
2119:     Hath scald thee for herself. For thou hast been
2235:       And thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen
2336:   Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
2136:     It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
1825:     I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
  95:     What we two nights have seen.
1005:   Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
1880:     Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
1727:   Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
1725:   1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'
1505:     have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen
2231:               Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.  
3507:     This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
4341:   Ham. How does the Queen?
3648:                            Enter Queen.
 273:     Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
 879:     The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
3650:     How now, sweet queen?
1892:                                                    [Exit Queen.]
2555:     My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
2613:     And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
1439:     will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
4179:   Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
3120:     When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
4175:     carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.  
3324:   King. Will you know them then?
3827:   Ham. What woman then?
1737:       But if the gods themselves did see her then,
1905:     O heavy burthen!
1389:     Be you and I behind an arras then.
3863:     your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath lien
3909:     And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
1238:   Queen. Ay, amen!
1426:   Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
3124:     The imminent death of twenty thousand men
 808:     Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
 472:   Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
 469:     Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
3967:   All. Gentlemen!
1036:   Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
1009:     Come hither, gentlemen,
2521:                                                Exeunt Gentlemen.
1595:   Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
 743:     The form of plausive manners, that these men
 736:     So oft it chances in particular men
1615:     the only men.
 196:     Unto our climature and countrymen.
 590:     Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
4444:     On plots and errors happen.
2088:     that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
1534:   Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
2188:     suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten
2585:     And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
 887:     Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
1717:       And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
 410:     That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
1742:       Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
 678:     With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
 100:     Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
 455:     Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
2581:     To heaven.
2784:     Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
 919:     Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
2577:     And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
2536:     O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
 363:     It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
 369:     Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
 607:     Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
1173:     As oft as any passion under heaven
2596:     Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
 960:   Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
 937:     Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
2974:     But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
3255:     Will nothing stick Our person to arraign
2949:     again.
 462:     I shall not look upon his like again.
3380:          He never will come again.
3376:          And will he not come again?
3377:          And will he not come again?
3493:     Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
 528:     Perchance 'twill walk again.
4305:   Laer. Well, again!
 106:   Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
 200:     But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
 395:     And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
3683:     Now fear I this will give it start again;
 198:                       Enter Ghost again.
3489:     Would have reverted to my bow again,
1889:     Will bring him to his wonted way again,
2722:   Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
 941:     That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
 939:     O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
1807:     Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
1806:     With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
  12:   Polonius, Lord Chamberlain.
2642:   Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
3468:     That he which hath your noble father slain
3241:     But in battalions! First, her father slain;
2905:     Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
4348:   Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
1261:   Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
 383:     And we beseech you, bend you to remain
4386:     And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
2771:   Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
2311:     Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,  
 936:     Within the book and volume of my brain,
 796:     Without more motive, into every brain
3067:                                    Exeunt [all but the Captain].
  29:   A Norwegian Captain.
2995:   Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
4030:   Hor. That is most certain.
 588:     Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
2791:   Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
2313:       And never come mischance between us twain!
4031:   Ham. Up from my cabin,
1656:     receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in
2945:     his authorities. But such officers do the King best service in
4227:   Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
1527:     faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
1644:     valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
3424:   Hor. Let them come in.
3157:   Queen. Let her come in.  
3334:                               A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
3284:   All. No, let's come in!
 234:     To his confine; and of the truth herein
1576:     twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in
1526:     piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
1664:     especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in
4297:     'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
3270:     And, as the world were now but to begin,
2542:     I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
 739:     Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
 629:     Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
2855:                   [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
2773:     Is very cunning in.
3276:                                                  A noise within.
3258:     Give, me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
4308:                [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
4401:                                                  [March within.]
2783:     Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
4387:     To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
1546:   Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
2935:   Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
1756:     your bounty. Take them in.
1257:   King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
4157:   Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
4219:   Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been in
2140:     And after we will both our judgments join
1604:   Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
1755:     honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in
 909:     Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
4313:   King. Our son shall win.
2982:     How now O What hath befall'n?
 130:     Such was the very armour he had on
2838:     I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
 323:     And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
4269:     Give us the foils. Come on.
1391:     And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
 194:     And prologue to the omen coming on,
 675:     In honourable fashion.
1814:     A scullion!  
 138:     But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
1497:   Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
1370:     Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
1777:     But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
4103:     Into a tow'ring passion.
1786:     Had he the motive and the cue for passion
1565:     against their own succession.
1851:     When we would bring him on to some confession
3721:     hold up Adam's profession.
1844:     Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
 201:     I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
 235:     This present object made probation.
1918:     That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation  
1566:   Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
3573:     And gem of all the nation.
 812:   Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
2024:     I have in quick determination
 320:     To show my duty in your coronation,  
3579:     If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
 795:     The very place puts toys of desperation,
2414:     amazement and admiration.
2740:   Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
3405:     No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
 636:     And they in France of the best rank and station
2197:     him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
3697:     seeks her own salvation?
1549:     innovation.
 778:   Mar. Look with what courteous action
3485:     Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
 593:     And keep you in the rear of your affection,  
2118:     And could of men distinguish, her election
1687:      discretion.
1106:     According to the phrase or the addition
3079:   Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
 368:     Why should we in our peevish opposition
 771:     So horridly to shake our disposition
1855:   Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
4244:     That might your nature, honour, and exception
 748:     Shall in the general censure take corruption
1569:     went to cuffs in the question.
1911:   Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
1065:     By this encompassment and drift of question
3407:     That I must call't in question.
4423:     But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
1939:     And thus the native hue of resolution
3785:     about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution,
 740:     By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
4123:   Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
 366:     For what we know must be, and is as common
 341:   Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
 143:     And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
1024:     To put an antic disposition on),  
3172:            And his sandal shoon.
2239:     Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
 769:     Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
 596:     If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
 893:     My custom always of the afternoon,
1747:   Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.-
4161:   Ham. What's his weapon?
 452:   Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
4086:   Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
3102:     That capability and godlike reason
 419:     (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
 741:     Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
 793:     Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
2010:     Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
4358:   All. Treason! treason!
1491:     fay, I cannot reason.
 716:   Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
2941:     demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the son
2753:     Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
1479:     or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
1473:   Ham. Denmark's a prison.
1470:     deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
3297:     Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.  
 530:   Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
 385:     Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
4005:     Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
2869:     Where is your son?
 379:     Than that which dearest father bears his son
 331:     But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
1098:     You laying these slight sullies on my son
1459:     On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
4447:     For he was likely, had he been put on,
1721:   Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on.
3066:   For. Go softly on.
2491: Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.
2865: Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
1197:   King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
1446:                     Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
2385:                 Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
2902:              Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
2932:                Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
2095:             Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.
1773:                             [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
1874:                             Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
2871:                           [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
2909:                           Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
3036:                             Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
1231:   King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
2900:     Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
 229:     The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
2709:     Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
1934:     The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
3518:     occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
2405:     your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
4194:     himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
2291:       But, orderly to end where I begun,  
2292:       Our wills and fates do so contrary run
 334:   Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
3227:             'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
1161:     And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
  49: Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
4051:     They had begun the play. I sat me down;
2007:     Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
  96:   Hor. Well, sit we down,
4212:   Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
 722:     And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
2832:     And break your own neck down.
1290:     As therein are set down.
 940:     My tables! Meet it is I set it down
2654:     Leave wringing of your hinds. Peace! sit you down
2730:                 Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.
1285:     With an entreaty, herein further shown,
3752:                                             [Exit Second Clown.]  
3271:     Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
1078:     As are companions noted and most known
 872:     Now wears his crown.
3700:   Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
 413:     As if increase of appetite had grown
2976:     Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
2003:   Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
2293:       That our devices still are overthrown;
2294:       Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
1754:     desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own  
 576:     His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
3358:   Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O,
  58:   Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
3599:     Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
1785:     That he should weep for her? What would he do,
 773:     Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
2816:   Queen. What shall I do?
1053: Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.
1057:   Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
1055:   Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
1070:     And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
1136:                                                   Exit Reynaldo.
2404:     If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do
2252:       My operant powers their functions leave to do.
2760:     My stern effects. Then what I have to do
2911:     And let them know both what we mean to do
3108:     Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
1031:     That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
  77:   Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
 430:           Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.
  55:   Fran. Bernardo?
2057:     players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do
 578:     He may not, as unvalued persons do,
 606:     Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
4053:     I once did hold it, as our statists do,
3979:   Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
2817:   Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
2433:     O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why do
1761:     Gonzago'?
2351:   Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago.  
1164:     And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
 328:     I do beseech you give him leave to go.
 747:     As infinite as man may undergo-  
1307:     But let that go.
2091:     and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go  
3193:          Which bewept to the grave did not go
 803:   Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
3483:     Why to a public count I might not go
4336:   Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
3182:     O, ho!
2638:     Help, help, ho!
4205:   Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who
1424:   Ham. Between who?
2063:     tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who
 464:   Ham. Saw? who?
4017: Enter Hamlet and Horatio.
2360:                               Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
4037:     Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
4098:     But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
3882:     favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio,
4392:   Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
 459:   Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
 437:     And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
3913:                                          [Retires with Horatio.]  
1018:     There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
2102:   Ham. What, ho, Horatio!
2104:                       Enter Horatio.
 980:   Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
 109:   Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
 112:   Mar. Question it, Horatio.
 108:   Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
3237:                                                  [Exit Horatio.]  
4002:                                                    Exit Horatio.
 456:     Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
2590:     No.
 524:   Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
2415:   Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no
3807:     scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have no
4302:   Laer. No.
4183:   Ham. How if I answer no?
1883:     If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
1512:     me, whether you were sent for or no.  
3719:     more than their even-Christen. Come, my spade! There is no
1964:   Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
1518:     discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
1573:   Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
4356:   Ham. The point envenom'd too?
3432:   Hor. Let him bless thee too.
3446:     to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too
4040:     Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
3439:     very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
3811:   Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
1875:   King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
1993:     monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
2251:     King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;  
3702:   Other. Why, 'tis found so.
2044:   King. It shall be so.
3402:   Laer. Let this be so.
4250:     Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
1159:     As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
2081:     Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
1971:   Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
3886:   Hor. E'en so.
 179:   Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
4190:   Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
2827:     Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?  
3893:   Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.  
1520:     mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so
2248:       And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
1376:     That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'

2808:     I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
2657:     If damned custom have not braz'd it so
3544:     The rather, if you could devise it so
2630:   Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
1972:   Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
 568:   Oph. No more but so?
3064:     And let him know so.
1531:     neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
 443:   Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
2219:   Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to
 111:   Ber. It would be spoke to.
1769:     My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome to

2423:     bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to
2394:   Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
2952:   Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to

2173:   Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
 604:   Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep

2310:       The tedious day with sleep.
1919:     Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
1915:     And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
 559:     And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
2363:          For some must watch, while some must sleep:
2750:     Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
2831:     To try conclusions, in the basket creep
2361:   Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
 432:   Hor. Hail to your lordship!
4192:   Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
1963:   Oph. What means your lordship?
2639:   Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
1167:     For out o' doors he went without their help
3019:     The bark is ready and the wind at help,
2114:     No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
1555:     sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top
1696:       Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
2829:     Unpeg the basket on the house's top,

 511:   Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
1734:       A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-  
1931:     With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
2370:          For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
2686:     Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
2040:     And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
1347:     All given to mine ear.
 784:   Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
2249:       Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
 481:     Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
 602:     Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
2518:     For we will fetters put upon this fear,
 575:     The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
3467:     Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
 471:   Ham. For God's love let me hear!
2765:   Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
 837:   Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
1254:   King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
2530:     Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
2951:   Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
 866:     Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
 838:   Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
2116:     Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
4428:     How these things came about. So shall You hear

2998:     we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar
 624:     Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
1336:           Doubt truth to be a liar;
 745:     Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
 189:     Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
1362:     'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
4449:     The soldiers' music and the rites of war
 144:     And foreign mart for implements of war;
3611:     Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
4127:   Ham. I beseech you remember.
  23:   Bernardo, officer.
  10:   Marcellus, Officer.
  22:   Marcellus, officer.
3604:     That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
2912:     And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
 110:   Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
1707:       As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
3965:   King. Pluck thein asunder.
3920:     And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
1864:     And, as I think, they have already order
1912:     Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
4277:     You know the wager?
4162:   Osr. Rapier and dagger.
2653:     Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
3498:     That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
 513:   Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
3262:                      Enter a Messenger.
3514:                                                  Exit Messenger.
2124:     That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
 522:   Both. Longer, longer.
1405:   Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
1363:     This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
1462:   Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
3141:   Queen. I will not speak with her.
3923:     Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
2198:     unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
1331:   Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
3930:     To sing a requiem and such rest to her
3976:     Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
1984:     father?
 357:     But you must know, your father lost a father;
1587:     entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father
3200:   King. Conceit upon her father.
 475:     Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
3591:   King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
 465:   Hor. My lord, the King your father.
 356:     To give these mourning duties to your father;
3621:     Requite him for your father.  
 487:     The apparition comes. I knew your father.
  35:   Ghost of Hamlet's Father.
 315:     Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
 457:     My father- methinks I see my father.

1385:   Pol. You know sometimes he walks four hours together
1295:     Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
3828:   Clown. For none neither.
1471:     hither?
4402:     Why does the drum come hither?
1876:     For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
1559:     dare scarce come thither.
4019:   Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
1147:     Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
4073:     Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,

3294:     Of my true mother.
3027:     Farewell, dear mother.
2616:   Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
3477:     But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
2854:     Good night, mother.
4087:     He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;

 409:     Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
2476:     Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
4282:   Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
3860:   Ham. Why he more than another?
4146:   Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in another
 171:     That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
2647:     As kill a king, and marry with his brother.  
 605:     As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
4257:     And hurt my brother.
 828:   Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
 586:     May give his saying deed; which is no further

2552:     Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?

  24:   Francisco, a soldier
  73:   Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
3764:   Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the daintier

4126:     he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter-
3264:     What is the matter?
1140:     How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
2622:   Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
3361:   Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
3997:     I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
4221:     think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
1322:                                              [Reads] the letter.

2551:     My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
3796:   Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
2154:   Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the air,
2398:     not so wildly from my affair.
4052:     Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
1962:   Ham. Are you fair?
 891:     But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
 712:   Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
 232:     Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,

4170:   Ham. What call you the carriages?
3045:     For like the hectic in my blood he rages,

2149:                        carrying torches.
2732:   Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
1303:     And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
2499:     Out of his lunacies.

2561:     There is no shuffling; there the action lies
2286:       The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
3323:   Laer. None but his enemies.
4049:   Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
1210:     Some little time; so by your companies
3240:     When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
4063:     And stand a comma 'tween their amities,

4088:     Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
2756:   Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
 848:     Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
 842:     And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,

1888:     Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
2867:   King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
4230:     the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he leaves,

2687:     Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?  
3516:     kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;

2512:     To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
1172:     And leads the will to desperate undertakings
4292:     Richer than that which four successive kings

3029:   Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is

4129:   Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is
1554:   Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,
3159:     [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
3359:     how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his
2074:     scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his

3256:     In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
1804:     To make oppression bitter, or ere this
1379:   Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if this
  97:     And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
3632:   King. Let's further think of this,
3585:     Now, out of this-
2762:   Queen. To whom do you speak this?
3871:   Ham. This?
1896:     Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
2908:     Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
2797:     Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
2675:   Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
1093:   Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
 406:     Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
3881:     chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
 408:     So excellent a king, that was to this
4451:     Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
 489:   Ham. But where was this?
2645:   Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
4388:     What warlike noise is this?
3259:   Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
4085:   Hor. Why, what a king is this!
1373:   King. Do you think 'tis this?

4156:   Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
1235:     And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
1038:     And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
3709:     man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,
2501:     Most holy and religious fear it is
 858:   Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
3435:     your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.

4419:     Where should We have our thanks?
 281:     With this affair along. For all, our thanks.

4319:   Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
1823:     Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;

2878:     And in this brainish apprehension kills
1449:   Ham. These tedious old fools!
3931:     As to peace-parted souls.
 772:     With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
1483:     king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.

2421:   Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
3244:     Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
4430:     Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
2194:                Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.
1393:     But keep a farm and carters.

2670:     Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
1287:     That it might please you to give quiet pass
1609:   Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
4397:     So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
4066:     Without debatement further, more or less,
3990:   Queen. This is mere madness;
1305:     Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
2778:     And I the matter will reword; which madness
2823:     That I essentially am not in madness,
4245:     Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
2776:     And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
2801:     And that shall lend a kind of easiness
3763:   Hor. Custom hath made it in him a Property of easiness.
1293:     Answer, and think upon this business.
2406:     shall be the end of my business.

3666:     As one incapable of her own distress,
4452:     Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
3160:     Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.

3087:   Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
3471:     Why you proceeded not against these feats
 453:   Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats

1678:          Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,

4395:     But I do prophesy th' election lights  
2359:   All. Lights, lights, lights!
1508:   Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
3151:     And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
3363:     remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
4255:     Free me so far in your most generous thoughts  
1532:   Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.  
4189:     shame and the odd hits.
2112:     That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
1829:     As he is very potent with such spirits,
2742:     But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
 693:     But mere implorators of unholy suits,  
3344:     O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits

3924:     Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
3602:     As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
2752:     Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
4065:     That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
 192:     And even the like precurse of fierce events,

3357:     It could not move thus.

2493:   King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
3062:     if that his Majesty would aught with us,

3872:   Clown. E'en that.
 637:     Are most select and generous, chief in that.
 786:     And for my soul, what can it do to that,
2579:     A villain kills my father; and for that,
3335:   Laer. How now? What noise is that?
 561:   Oph. Do you doubt that?
3878:     now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
1354:     (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
4125:     tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that
1095:     I would know that.

1529:     beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what
2939:   Ros. Believe what?
1992:     needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
 839:   Ham. What?
1495:     dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what
3201:   Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you what
 230:     Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
1800:     Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
3961:     I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
2877:     Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
3761:   Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
1649:     all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
2274:       To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
3147:     Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
2672:     Is thought-sick at the act.
2594:     At gaming, swearing, or about some act
2661:   Ham. Such an act
2161:   Ham. What did you enact?
 157:     Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
3142:   Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
 623:     Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
4371:     That are but mutes or audience to this act,
 917:     But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
2673:   Queen. Ay me, what act,
 744:     Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
1315:     Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
 897:     The leperous distilment; whose effect
1314:     That we find out the cause of this effect-
3043:     By letters congruing to that effect,
3636:     'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
1780:     Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
1923:     Must give us pause. There's the respect
2714:     As will not leave their tinct.
1229:     To lay our service freely at your feet,
2171:                                   [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]

3759:          O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.
1023:     (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
3793:            For such a guest is meet.
3817:               For such a guest is meet.

3234:     counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night, sweet
2846:     And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
3757:          Methought it was very sweet;
2273:       Most necessary 'tis that we forget
3968:   Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
1845:     Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
2727:     And put it in his pocket!  
1342:                                                           HAMLET.'

 653:   Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.  
 698:     As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
3427:     I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

1096:   Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
 860:   Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
3698:   Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
 734:     From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
3341:     By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
1679:          That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
2297:     Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
3781:     prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it- might
1029:     Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
2298:       Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
2805:     With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
  63:   Ber. Well, good night.
2812:     The death I gave him. So again, good night.
  72:   Fran. Give you good night.
 474:     In the dead vast and middle of the night
 841:     Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
2472:     'Tis now the very witching time of night,
 113:   Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
3033:     Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
 504:     Hold you the watch to-night?
 527:   Ham. I will watch to-night.
 248:     Let us impart what we have seen to-night
 988:   Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
2872:     Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
  82:   Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
2800:     That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
 535:     And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
 463:   Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  88:     With us to watch the minutes of this night,
4272:     Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
4375:     Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright  
 969:   Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
3546:   King. It falls right.
1043:     That ever I was born to set it right!
1359:     Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
 498:     And vanish'd from our sight.
 533:     If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
4407:   Fort. Where is this sight?
2700:     Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
3037:     And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
1953:     I never gave you aught.
 654:   Pol. Marry, well bethought!
3153:     Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
 493:     But answer made it none. Yet once methought
2586:     But in our circumstance and course of thought,
1940:     Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
3565:     With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
2066:     Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
1430:     sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it
3085:   Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
4193:   Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
1060:   Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
3891:     imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
 952:   Ham. So be it!
4169:     very liberal conceit.
1778:     Could force his soul so to his own conceit
2452:     excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
 175:     So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
3596:     A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
 584:     It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
4377:   Hor. Never believe it.
2938:   Ham. Do not believe it.
 244:   Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
 558:     And, sister, as the winds give benefit
3594:     Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
 794:     And draw you into madness? Think of it.
2792:   Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
1663:     I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
 502:     To let you know of it.
 650:     And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
2875:     Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
4226:     repair hither and say you are not fit.
2888:     We would not understand what was most fit,
4266:     And will not wrong it.
1067:     Than your particular demands will touch it.
4287:     If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
4304:   Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
 251:     Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
 780:     But do not go with it!
 775:   Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
 962:   Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
1601:   Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.-
 959:   Ham. No, you will reveal it.
1201:     Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
4178:     bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call it?
 958:   Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
3082:     To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
3625:     So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
4235:                A table and flagons of wine on it.  
  90:     He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
 491:   Ham. Did you not speak to it?
3309:     Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
1153:     But truly I do fear it.
4435:   Fort. Let us haste to hear it,  
2400:   Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit
 840:   Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
4393:     The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
3331:     And am most sensibly in grief for it,
 292:     Thus much the business is: we have here writ
3865:   Ham. Whose was it?
4249:     Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
1233:     And I beseech you instantly to visit
1903:     Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
3150:     The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
 816:   Hor. Heaven will direct it.
1302:     Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
 782:   Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
 788:     It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
 547: Exit.
2314: Exit.
3031: Exit.
3389: Exit.
4000: Exit.
 924:     Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.  
1832:     Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.
3130:     My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.
 651:   Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
3047:     Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.
2601:     Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.
2002:     they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
2469:   Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit.
3092:   Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
2599:     This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
3235:     ladies. Good night, good night.                         Exit
  76:     Give you good night.                                   Exit.
3680:     But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.
2483:     To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.
2225:       We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]
1394:   King. We will try it.
4324:   King. I do not think't.
3339:     O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
 398:   Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
3162:     It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
2134:     Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
3161:     So full of artless jealousy is guilt
1991:     calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
1091:     Of general assault.  
3420: Enter Horatio with an Attendant.
 264: Lords Attendant.
3906:              Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]
3425:                                                [Exit Attendant.]
2218:   Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
3561:     And they can well on horseback; but this gallant  
4070:   Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
4153:   Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
1097:     And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
 446:     Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
1228:     And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
3020:     Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
2280:       Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
3542:     And call it accident.
 450:   Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
4171:   Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent
2591:     Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
2482:     How in my words somever she be shent,
 364:     A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
2279:       Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
2425:   Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
4261:     I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
1180:     I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
4303:   Ham. Judgment!
3247:     Divided from herself and her fair-judgment,
2692:     And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
 632:     Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
 627:     But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
1941:     And enterprises of great pith and moment
3118:     Is not to stir without great argument,
4006:     This grave shall have a living monument.
4079:   Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
 601:     Contagious blastments are most imminent.
3128:     Which is not tomb enough and continent
2566:     Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
4151:     spent.
2027:     Haply the seas, and countries different,
3840:     very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
 327:     Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
 161:     Against the which a moiety competent
2540:     My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
 380:     Do I impart toward you. For your intent  
3401:     To give it due content.
4076:     Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
3114:     Makes mouths at the invisible event,  
3105:     Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
2023:     Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
3829:   Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
1433:   Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.-
2319:   King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
1662:     sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in't
2595:     That has no relish of salvation in't-
3629:     This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
3819:   Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
3788:     on't.
3215:   Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!
2537:     It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
 124:     What think you on't?
2031:     From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
 945:     I have sworn't.
2886:     Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
 701:                                                          Exeunt.
 818:                                                          Exeunt.
1045:                                                          Exeunt.
1190:                                                          Exeunt.
2208:                                                          Exeunt.
2918:                                                          Exeunt.
2958:                                                          Exeunt.
3411:                                                           Exeunt
3685:                                                          Exeunt.
4009:                                                          Exeunt.
3454:     To him from whom you brought them.                   Exeunt.
2045:     Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.
 254:     Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.
 911:     No reckoning made, but sent to my account
2511:     Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
3622:   Laer. I will do't!
2192:     epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'
4412:     That thou so many princes at a shot
4120:   Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
3126:     Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
3292:     Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
1974:     not.
4154:   Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
 611:   Laer. O, fear me not!
2156:   King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are not
3398:     To you in satisfaction; but if not,  
2538:     A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
 989:   Both. My lord, we will not.
3509:   Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
2041:     Of all their conference. If she find him not,
3008:   Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not
1767:   Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
2438:   Guil. My lord, I cannot.
2440:   Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
4124:   Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I cannot
2407:   Ham. Sir, I cannot.
3231:   Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
1390:     Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
3711:     him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not
3101:     Looking before and after, gave us not
1627:   Ham. Nay, that follows not.
3782:     it not?
2795:     Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
2565:     Try what repentance can. What can it not?
 914:   Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
3777:     might it not?
4220:     continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not
1415:   Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
1765:     insert in't, could you not?
1127:     Shall you my son. You have me, have you not
 137:   Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
3867:   Ham. Nay, I know not.
3890:   Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
1552:   Ros. No indeed are they not.  
2132:     I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
1675:          With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
 509:   Both. My lord, from head to foot.
4453:     Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
3855:   Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
3219:             Young men will do't if they come to't
1416:     as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
3742:   Clown. To't.
4078:   Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
1631:            'As by lot, God wot,'
 863:   Ghost. I find thee apt;
3589:     A face without a heart,'
 313:     The head is not more native to the heart,
2127:     In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
3146:     There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
2029:     This something-settled matter in his heart,
  60:     And I am sick at heart.
4384:     If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
 926:     And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
3527:     It warms the very sickness in my heart
 990:   Ham. Nay, but swear't.
1902:     The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
 164:     Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
1312:     But farewell it, for I will use no art.  
3392:     Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
 971:     I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
 448:     We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
4116:   Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart
2416:     sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
 849:     Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
 974:     Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
1308:   Queen. More matter, with less art.
2397:   Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start
1752:   Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
2759:     Lest with this piteous action you convert
4115:     a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.  
 445:     To make it truster of your own report
3575:     And gave you such a masterly report
1148:     And with a look so piteous in purport
1738:       When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
1364:     That she should lock herself from his resort,
1185:     As it is common for the younger sort
4359:   King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
1863:     To hear of it. They are here about the court,
1209:     That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
 875:   Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
1667:          'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'
1256:     My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
2257:       Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
1368:     Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
1014:   Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
3858:     will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last
 326:     By laboursome petition, and at last
 933:     All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
2698:     To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
3568:   Laer. A Norman was't?
 916:     A couch for luxury and damned incest.
3823:     the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
  21:   A Priest.
3934:     May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
2806:     And when you are desirous to be blest,
1467:   Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
1960:   Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
2256:     Queen. O, confound the rest!
4400:     And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
2777:     That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
 986:     Give me one poor request.
 730:     This heavy-headed revel east and west
 853:     To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
3266:     The ocean, overpeering of his list,
 726:   Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
 104:                         Enter Ghost.
 752:                          Enter Ghost.
 834:   Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
 120:                                                      Exit Ghost.
 221:                                                      Exit Ghost.
2770:                                                      Exit Ghost.
1956:     As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
3491:   Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
4259:     Whose motive in this case should stir me most
1494:     servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
 425:     She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
2259:       None wed the second but who killed the first.
1759:                  Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
1476:     dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
2258:       When second husband let me be accurst!
4312:   Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
 338:     Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
 878:     So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
2244:       Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
 905:     Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
2243:       That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
 904:     And a most instant tetter bark'd about,  
4201:     them to their trial-the bubbles are out,
3090:     That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
3283:   Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
4295:     The trumpet to the cannoneer without,  
2804:     And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
2822:     Make you to ravel all this matter out,
2473:     When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
 804:   Ham. My fate cries out
1125:     By indirections find directions out.
1578:     philosophy could find it out.
4346:     Treachery! Seek it out.
 723:     The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
 523:   Hor. Not when I saw't.
4369:     I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
1340:     it. Adieu.
3444:     them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou
3989:     I'll rant as well as thou.
2255:       For husband shalt thou-
1616:   Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
3529:     'Thus didest thou.'
1685:     So, proceed you.
1973:     inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you
  74:     Who hath reliev'd you?
 519:   Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
1198:     Moreover that we much did long to see you,
2448:   Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
2494:     To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
1217:     To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
1893:   Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
3009:     there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if you
1215:   Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
1234:     My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
1441:     my leave of you.
3574:   King. He made confession of you;
2636:     Where you may see the inmost part of you.
1997:     given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you
4048:   Hor. I beseech you.
2441:   Ham. I do beseech you.
2853:     Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
2387:   Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
 436:   Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
2496:     And he to England shall along with you.
 308:     And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
2747:   Queen. Alas, how is't with you,  
3584:     Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
3388:     And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi', you.
1498:   Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;
4421:     Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
1100:     Mark you,
4373:     Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
 982:     It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
1603:   Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
 659:     And that in way of caution- I must tell you
 560:     But let me hear from you.
2352:     The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
 333:   King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
 516:   Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
1492:   Both. We'll wait upon you.  
1748:     Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
1420:     for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do you
 648:     What I have said to you.
 652:   Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
1037:     With all my love I do commend me to you;
3824:   Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
2401:     hath sent me to you.
1039:     May do t' express his love and friending to you,
 470:     This marvel to you.
3587:   King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
2055:   Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
1032:     So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
2411:     my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother, you  
3365:   Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you,
3433:   Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you,
3423:   Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for you.
1506:     have sent for you.
 583:     Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
1355:     Before my daughter told me), what might you,
 539:     I'll visit you.
 972:     You, as your business and desires shall point you,
3236:   King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
2439:   Ham. I pray you.
3073:   Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
 506:   Ham. Arm'd, say you?
1513:   Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
4311:     Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
3314:   King. Who shall stay you?
1885:   Queen. I shall obey you;
 823: Scene V.
3136: Scene V.
 706: Scene IV.
2606: Scene IV.
3053: Scene IV.
2946:     the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;
 289:     Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
3902:     Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
3713:   Other. But is this law?
3714:   Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
2509:     Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw  
3119:     But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
3088:     Will not debate the question of this straw.
1591:     know a hawk from a handsaw.
 399:     Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
4426:     High on a stage be placed to the view;
 226:   Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
4034:     Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
3155:   Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
1486:   Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
1488:     it is but a shadow's shadow.
3206:             And I a maid at your window,
 353:     But I have that within which passeth show-
 692:     Not of that dye which their investments show,
4200:     through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but blow
1706:       The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
2600:   King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
2669:     A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
3684:     Therefore let's follow.
3908:     The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
1556:     of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort. These are now
3169:          How should I your true-love know
 253:     Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
1378:   King. Not that I know.
2533:     And tell you what I know.
2824:     But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
 679:   Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
4025:     And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
3107:     And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
1152:   Oph. My lord, I do not know,
4056:     It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
2247:       Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
1633:  and then, you know,
3735:     But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
4323:   Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
2628:   Ham. What's the matter now?
4055:     How to forget that learning; but, sir, now  
 713:   Ham. What hour now?
4211:     I be so able as now.
3186:     (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-
3382:          His beard was as white as snow,
2306:   Ham. If she should break it now!
1121:     See you now-
 573:     Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,  
4331:   Laer. Have at you now!
1943:     And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
1157:     And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
2677:     See what a grace was seated on this brow;
1562:     sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
4081:     Does by their own insinuation grow.
2498:     Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
4291:     And in the cup an union shall he throw
3985:     And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
1758:   Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
3588:     Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
3954:     Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
 882:     That it went hand in hand even with the vow
2706:     To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
2674:     That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
1969:     translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox,
1947:     How does your honour for this many a day?
 148:     Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
2475:     And do such bitter business as the day
 642:     And it must follow, as the night the day,
 373:     From the first corse till he that died to-day,
 393:     No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
1115:     I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
3204:     (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
3999:     The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
4075:     The changeling never known. Now, the next day  
3899:     Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
1927:     The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
4023:     That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
1816:     That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
2362:           The hart ungalled play;
2212:   Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
2221:   Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.
2322:   King. What do you call the play?
2357:   Pol. Give o'er the play.
2037:     But if you hold it fit, after the play
4329:   Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
4284:                                                 Prepare to play.
4215:     Laertes before you fall to play.  
2316:   Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
 352:     For they are actions that a man might play;
4300:   Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play.
4268:     And will this brother's wager frankly play.
3670:     Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
3998:     Let Hercules himself do what he may,
3342:     Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
2584:     With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
2917:     My soul is full of discord and dismay.
1891:   Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
 670:     That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
1041:     And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
 975:     Look you, I'll go pray.
2412:     say-
2739:     O, say!
1109:   Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?
  78:   Ber. Say-
2569:     Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.  
1116:     Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
2410:     answer is I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,
2159:     i' th' university, you say?
2059:     gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
3849:   Clown. Very strangely, they say.
2364:           Thus runs the world away.
3900:     Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
2896:   King. O Gertrude, come away!
2916:     And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
 396:     Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
 497:     And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
1399:   Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
4247:     If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
 118:   Ber. See, it stalks away!
2767:   Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!  
2358:   King. Give me some light! Away!
1572:   Ham. Do the boys carry it away?  
4330:   Osr. Nothing neither way.
 300:     For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,  
  28:   Fortinbras, Prince of Norway.  
 153:     Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
1268:     Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
2841:     They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
 669:   Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
1386:     Here in the lobby.
3011:     the stair, into the lobby.
2468:     top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
4321:   Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
2737:     That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
1253:     The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
1846:     With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
2828:     No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
2748:     That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
4167:     so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
2224:       Here stooping to your clemency,
1086:     That he is open to incontinency.
1403:   Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
2546:     To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
1021:     Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
 995:   Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
4077:     Thou know'st already.
2165:     the players ready.
2092:     make you ready.
2815:     One word more, good lady.
3177:     (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,  
2746:   Ham. How is it with you, lady?
3196:   King. How do you, pretty lady?
2223:     Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
1214:     That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
2381:          For if the King like not the comedy,
1610:   Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
3559:     Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
2934:   Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
2968:   King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
 900:     The natural gates and alleys of the body,
2907:     Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
2954:   Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.
 906:     All my smooth body.
 805:     And makes each petty artire in this body
 417:     With which she followed my poor father's body
 582:     Unto the voice and yielding of that body
2382:          Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
 634:     But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
1227:   Guil. But we both obey,
1543:     they?
1560:   Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
4332:                 [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
3720:     ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers. They
4391:     This warlike volley.
1019:     Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
1618:   Ham. Why,
1629:   Ham. Why,
3845:   Ham. Why?
2084:     humanity so abominably.
4267:   Ham. I embrace it freely,
4074:     Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
3850:   Ham. How strangely?
1926:     Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
2422:   Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely
2348:       On wholesome life usurp immediately.
4110:     waterfly?
 512:   Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
3706:     argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
4024:     Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
3154:     Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
 978:     Yes, faith, heartily.
 977:   Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
4326:   Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
4147:     tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
3577:     And for your rapier most especially,
3696:   Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully
3245:     For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
1828:     Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
 389:   King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
1857:     Most free in his reply.
1584:     appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply
 671:     Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
 660:     You do not understand yourself so clearly
4121:   Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
2436:   Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
3630:     With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
 517:   Hor. Most constantly.
2460:   Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
2098:   Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
1818:     Been struck so to the soul that presently
1087:     That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
2290:       Directly seasons him his enemy.
4252:     His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
2365:     Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of my
1493:   Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
1519:     feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all my
2450:     pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
1979:     I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
1443:     willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my
4188:     I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my
1490:     heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by my
3856:   Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have many
3601:     And hath abatements and delays as many  
2418:   Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
1001:   Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
3352:            (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
3853:   Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy  
 275:     Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
1862:     And there did seem in him a kind of joy
2301:       Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
1281:     Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
2277:       The violence of either grief or joy
3371:     [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
2278:       Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
2302:       Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
1458:   Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
2089:     spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary
4060:     As England was his faithful tributary,
3277:   Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!  
3641:     When in your motion you are hot and dry-  
2948:     glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry
 158:     Well ratified by law and heraldry,
 640:     And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
4340:     I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
 225:     And our vain blows malicious mockery.

2269:       Purpose is but the slave to memory,
 621:     And these few precepts in thy memory
 931:     Yea, from the table of my memory
2388:   Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  94:     That are so fortified against our story,
1113:   Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
2183:   Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
1174:     That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
2289:       And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
1107:     Of man and country-
2680:     A station like the herald Mercury
1659:     there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
1942:     With this regard their currents turn awry
1989:   Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
2802:     To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
 123:     Is not this something more than fantasy?
  84:   Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
2774:   Ham. Ecstasy?
2772:     This bodiless creation ecstasy
3598:     For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
1182:     And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
1226:     Than to entreaty.
3015:   King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
1545:     tragedians of the city.
2270:       Of violent birth, but poor validity;
3548:     And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
1419:     gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much extremity
2246:       In neither aught, or in extremity.
 881:     From me, whose love was of that dignity
 340:     Passing through nature to eternity.  
 591:     To his unmast'red importunity.
1310:     That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
3217:     [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,  
2245:       For women's fear and love holds quantity,
 738:     As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
3319:     If you desire to know the certainty
1079:     To youth and liberty.
1088:     That they may seem the taints of liberty,
2347:       Thy natural magic and dire property
2662:     That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
3894:   Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
2508:     The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
2503:     That live and feed upon your Majesty.
1280:     To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
4185:   Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty,
4117:     a thing to you from his Majesty.
1966:   Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
2429:     musty.

2718:     Over the nasty sty!
1965:     discourse to your beauty.
 252:     As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
 501:     And we did think it writ down in our duty
 305:   Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
 304:     Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
 633:     Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,  
3582:     Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
2147:     march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
1232:   Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.  
2980:                     Enter Rosencrantz.
1607:   Ham. Buzz, buzz!
